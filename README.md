This benchmark was originally created from the examples of the [SHACL core specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)
and adapted and extended for further use.

It consists of separate turtle files representing each one constraint type example,
additionally there are separate modules combining several constraint types.

Therefore the `benchmark` directory contains the following folders

* `value-type`
* `cardinality`
* `value-range`
